===================
Here is a TODO list:
===================
===================
(in no order)



Proof of Concept:
================
Done - Need to test having an XNA control in a windows form. 
Done - Need to be able to use Content.  spritefont, pictures, etc in the xna control.
Done - Have a game update that allows up to date drawing
Done - Need to be able to refresh the screen all the time
- Need to create a game object that will store all the game data and can be saved in the database.  
	So turns can be passed back and forth amongst the players.



Client - Windows Form
=====================
- Display Player's stats when logged in.
- Display errors that help the player to understand what is wrong.
- Lobby needs to be redone.  Single player vs Multi player.
- Create game for multi, and then allow other players to join it, or invite other players to game.
- Then start when all player slots have been filled.
- 



Client - XNA Game
=================
- Convert Content data from bmp to png.  Could save a lot of space... 188k to 27k.
- Convert Content data from 320x200 to 640x400 sizes.  Might speed up game, but will increase space needed.
- Screen - Select Wizard - Mouse Over buttons displays that character in portrait location.
- Screen - Select Banner - Need to be able to display the "Building World Maps..." box
- screen - Game - Need to create a map that is different every time.
- screen - Game - Name the starting city - not important at the beginning.
- screen - Game - Game Map details... left clicks, right clicks.

Server
